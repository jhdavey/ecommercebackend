To install, pull down the files from the repo. Then run `npm install` in the directory you would like to work in. Open Mysql Shell and run `db/schema.sql` to create the database, then exit Mysql. Run `npm run seed` to seed your database.
  
## Usage
  
Once you have installed the app, right click on one of your files in the directory you're working in. Click "Open in Integrated Terminal". Then in your command line, type `npm start`. Once you've created your database, seeded it with data, and started your server, you can open Insomnia or a similar tool run your endpoints. 

Use `/api/products/` to view all products.

Use `/api/categories/` to view all categories.

Use `/api/tags/` to view all tags.


Use `/api/products/<id number here>` to get a specific product based on id.

Use `/api/categories/<id number here>` to get a specific category based on id.

Use `/api/tags/<id number here>` to get a specific tag based on id.

You can also use post, put, and delete methods to create, update, and delete data based on the endpoint being used.
